                        4
                 2            7
           1         3    6         9
   
   Output:
                        4
                7             2
          9          6    3         1
          
   ---------------
   
   Algorithm:
   
   1. We are using depth first approach with post order traversal (left node, right node, and current node)
      
      Try drawing a tree like the following:
      
                                       4(L, R, M)
                     2(L, R, M)                        7(L, R, M)
           1(L, R, M)         3(L, R, M)    6(L, R, M)            9(L, R, M)
           
   2. If you hand trace the algorithm using the solution below:
   
      We first visit node all the way to the right corner, then come up.
      Once we are done with 7, it will look like:
      
                         4
                 2            7
           1         3    9         6
           
      
      Then we come up, and go to the left side, once we are done with 2, it will look like:
      
                         4
                 2            7
           3         1    9         6
     
     Finally, once we are done with both 2 on the left and 7 on the right, we swap the nodes, so the answer will be:
     
                        4
                7             2
          9          6    3         1
          
     
     I recommend hand tracing the algorithm, to get a better understanding on what's happening.
     
     ------------
     
     Time-Complexity: O(N), N is the number of nodes in the tree, we visit each node in the tree only once.
     Space-Complexity: Because of recursion, O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n).
